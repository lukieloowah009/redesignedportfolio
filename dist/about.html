            <h1>Journey</h1>
            <p>I was born and raised in Yangon, a buzzling city in Myanmar. With the unconditional support of<br> my parents, I was able to attend Crane International School Myanmar on merit and need based 
              <br>scholarship until Grade 10. Being more enthusiastic to explore more opportunities, I took a <br>gap year volunteering at local communities organizations helping the elderly and orphages while 
              <br>taking part in YMCA and YWCA's charitable volunteering activites. After this incredible year <br>I won a full scholarship to attend an IB international boarding high school located among
              <br>the beautiful mountains and fjords of Norway. In this beautiful place, I was roomates with <br>students from all over the world including an Ethiopian, Palestinian, Canadian and Norwegian in
              <br>my first year and in my second year, I shared room with a Malaysian, Portugese, Ghanian and <br>a Nepali. I had a chance to go skiiing, hiking, kayaking in the fjords, ice skating and experiencing exotic
              <br>Norweign traditions. These 2 years will forever be the best years of my life. After this <br>incredible two years, I had a chance to study Computer Science at the Unversity of Florida, again on
              <br>full scholarship where I will graduate in May 2021.
