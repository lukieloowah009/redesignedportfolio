With the unconditional support of<br> my parents, I was able to attend Crane International School Myanmar on merit and need based <br>scholarship until Grade 10. Being more enthusiastic to explore more opportunities, I took a <br>gap year volunteering at local communities organizations helping the elderly and orphages while <br>taking part in YMCA and YWCA's charitable volunteering activites. After this incredible year <br>I won a full scholarship to attend an IB international boarding high school located among <br>the beautiful mountains and fjords of Norway. In this beautiful place, I was roomates with <br>students from all over the world including an Ethiopian, Palestinian, Canadian and Norwegian in <br>my first year and in my second year, I shared room with a Malaysian, Portugese, Ghanian and <br>a Nepali. I had a chance to go skiiing, hiking, kayaking in the fjords, ice skating and experiencing exotic <br>Norweign traditions. These 2 years will forever be the best years of my life. After this <br>incredible two years, I had a chance to study Computer Science at the Unversity of Florida, again on <br>full scholarship where I will graduate in May 2021. </p> </div> <img src=\"/9144bbc6ae7fc545444e803132a5dd7a.jpg\" alt=\"about\"> </div> </section> </main> <script src=\"/42f69825340f0b5fa628d80900a46daa.js\"></script> </body></html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"d021b1a6a3b22a636f1ae5b4b0816ae7","cacheData":{}}
